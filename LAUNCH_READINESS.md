# Launch Readiness

Last reviewed: 2026-05-25

## Status

This project passed the current lightweight launch-readiness pass.

## Checks

- Git repo was clean before launch-polish edits.
- Unit/demo tests pass with `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test*.py"`.
- No real secrets should be committed; demo fixtures must use clearly fake placeholders.
- Keep generated reports synthetic and safe for public examples.

## Before Public Launch

- Re-run `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test*.py"`.
- Review README for clear install/run instructions.
- Confirm `.env`, credentials, customer logs, and private scan outputs are not tracked.
- If the project exposes a web/API surface, review dependency versions and CORS/auth assumptions.
